## Linear-Regression-and-Applications
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers Linear Regression and it's applications

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors).

#### Applications of Linear Regression

**Predictive Modeling:**

House price prediction based on features like area, location, etc.
Sales forecasting using past sales data.

**Trend Analysis:**

Stock market trends.
Temperature prediction based on historical data.

**Risk Assessment:**

Predicting insurance claims.
Assessing loan default risk.

**Healthcare:**

Predicting patient health outcomes (e.g., disease progression based on age and medical history).

**Optimization:**

Business operations improvement (e.g., predicting demand for supply chain optimization).


#### Advantages
Easy to interpret and implement.

Works well with linearly correlated data.

Efficient for large datasets.

#### Limitations
Assumes linearity; cannot model non-linear relationships effectively.

Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.

Requires normally distributed residuals for optimal performance.
